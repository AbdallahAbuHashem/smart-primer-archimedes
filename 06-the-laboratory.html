<p>The building was broken down where the others on the street seemed brand new. The fa&ccedil;ade was chipping, the window shutters were tilted and the door hung ajar. Planks of wood and blocks of stone sat outside the door, waiting for a moment they would be put into use. And very distinct noises came from inside: shuffling and banging, as if a giant wandered the inside and every time he took a step, another item in the building was bounced off its shelf. Sosibios was right; you really couldn't miss it.</p>
<p>But nobody else on the street seemed to take any notice. Apparently the disarray and discontinuity of Archimedes' home was a well-known sight. %%NAME%% made %%POS%% way up to the front door and peered inside.</p>
<p>"Hello?" %%SUBPRO%% called out.  There was no answer. "Helloooo?"</p>
<p>Still no response. %%NAME%% was about to try again when %%SUBPRO%% heard, "I need more time than that. You expect me to find you an answer in 2 hours? Psh. Ridiculous!"</p>
<p>The voice was slowly moving toward %%OBJPRO%%, and soon enough a man emerged from the dim light of the room. </p>
<p>"Oh! I'm so sorry! I thought you were my fool of a cousin."</p>
<p>"Sorry?" %%NAME%% said, confused, before connecting the dots. "Oh! You mean the king!? No, I'm definitely not him."</p>
<p>"Well I can see that, obviously. But who are you?"</p>
<p>%%NAME%% shared %%POS%% name and explained that %%SUBPRO%% wished to learn more about the crown.</p>
<p>"Well, come in then. Take a seat somewhere."</p>
<p>%%NAME%% tentatively followed the frazzled man into his home, picking %%POS%% way through stacks of paper and pieces of wood, stone, and metal. As %%SUBPRO%% stepped around a corner, %%SUBPRO%% accidently brushed a plank of wood off a table. It clattered to the floor and %%NAME%% let out an apology. Now %%SUBPRO%% knew the source of the noises %%SUBPRO%% heard outside.</p>
<p>A barefoot Archimedes perched himself cross-legged on a stool and gestured toward another. %%NAME%% took a seat.</p>
<p>"Now why don't you tell me a bit more about yourself, %%NAME%%. You can start with those funny clothes of yours."</p>
<p>It took %%NAME%% a moment to figure out a reasonable response, "Well...I'm  not from around here. Where I'm from, far to the west of here, these clothes are quite normal." %%SUBPRO_CAP%% was, after all, from far to the West of Greece. Further, even, than had been explored in that time.</p>
<p>"Hmmm," Archimedes pondered, before he gave a nod, as if deciding not to pursue that line of questioning further. "Alright, and what made you decide to come asking about the crown?"</p>
<p>"It's true that I'm a visitor, but I'd heard how friendly the people of this city were. When I got here, everyone seemed to be upset and the city was in turmoil. I figure I only have a short time here, so I might as well use that time in a way that returns the city to its normal welcoming ways. I know it's odd that someone who isn't from here would taken on the problem, but I really do want to help if I can."</p>
<p>"Alright, alright. Well here's what happened. The king decided to hold a ceremony honoring the gods for his successes and luck. So he commissioned the goldsmith to make a crown to give as an offering. He carefully weighed out gold and gave it to the smith and a few days later, sure enough, he received a crown of the exact some weight, so assumed it was legitimate. The fool he is! Everyone knows the smith overcharges! Why would he treat the king any better? A crook is a crook.</p>
<p>"So now there are rumors spreading that the smith switched out a part of the gold for an equal weight of silver, and my fool of a cousin wants me to determine if that's true. Without ruining the crown, no less! Ridiculous!"</p>
<p>"So what are you going to do?" %%NAME%% asked in captivated curiosity.</p>
<p>"Well, I have some ideas, but don't know if they'll work. Say, do you want to help? I could use an assistant if you prove yourself capable."</p>
<p>%%NAME%% hesitated. Prove %%OBJPRO%%self capable? %%POS_CAP%% mission was to stop the uproar in the city. But then %%SUBPRO%% realized that if %%SUBPRO%% could get to the bottom of this mystery with the goldsmith and determine the facts, %%SUBPRO%% might be able to help. %%NAME%% heartily agreed to assist Archimedes.</p>
<p>"Wonderful!" the man exclaimed. "I have an idea, but I need someone with some brains to help. Do you think you're up to it? Way back when, I went to school with a man named Aristippus, a very dear friend of mine, but I guess you could say we never quite got over our boyhood rivalry. Every once in awhile, he'll send me a puzzle challenge. I got another one from him just yesterday,  and I'd like you to solve it. Here's what he's given me:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><b>N</b> 037&deg; 025.629'</p>
<p><b>W</b> 122&deg; 010.238'</p>
<p>Stand at the center of this circle, and you'll encounter one of the Oreads--the mountain nymphs of Greek mythology. The cache container is made up a very small piece of the Oreads' home.</p>
<p> Hint: The Oreads sing above middle "C."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"From what I gather, those are latitude and longitude coordinates for a specific place on a map. Latitude is a north/south location on the globe, where 0 degrees is the equator, and longitude is an east-west location, where 0 degrees is on the Prime Meridian, which runs through a town in England named Greenwich. Would you like to learn more about [latitude and longitude coordinates]?"</p>
<p>"I believe the next line in Aristippus' puzzle is some description that might make sense when you get there, and the hint is there in case you are really having trouble. If you'd like, I can give you [directions to these coordinates.]"</p>
<p>IMAGE HERE </p>
<p>"Alright, when you've found what Aristippus has hidden would you write up a description of what it is and where you found it? I need to prove that his puzzle was solved. And one more thing: he sent the puzzle along with a message. He said that you're looking for a small, man-made object, no bigger than my head, and that he had a friend place it in it's spot."</p>

<p><i>Describe what you found and where you found it.</i></p>
