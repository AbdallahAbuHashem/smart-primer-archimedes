<br><h3>A New Plan</h3>

<p>"Alright! Enter that last value into the table and we can take a look at our results."</p>
<p>%%NAME%% scribbled the last number down and looked up at Archimedes.</p>
<p>"Well," Archimedes prompted. "What do the results tell you?"</p>
<p>%%NAME%% glanced at the paper. "The mass of the bottle changes a lot when you fill it with different materials. But you were right! The volume stays the same. And the volume matched the volume on the label."</p>
<p>"Exactly! So objects of different material that are the same volume weigh different amounts. I think we can capture this relationship in something called density. Density is mass divided by volume (D = M / V). So basically what we are saying is that all materials have different densities. Therefore gold should have a different density than silver.</p>
<p>"Now, I'm desperately in need of a bath, but I think with this knowledge we have enough information to solve the king's problem. Don't you? Will you write up a proposal for an experiment and bring it to me in the bath house just down the street when you are done?"</p>

<p><i>How will you determine whether the crown is gold or not?</i></p>
