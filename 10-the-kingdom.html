<p>Shortly after discovering the impurity of the crown (thanks to your help), King Hiero made an announcement to the city that, while the crown could not be used as an offering, the festival would go on and they would find another way to honor the gods. The people of the city turned their mood from anger to excitement as they still had something to celebrate.</p>
<p>The confectioner, Sosibios, was endorsed directly by the king (likely by suggestion of Archimedes, who very greatly appreciated your help) for his role in connecting you with Archimedes. </p>
<p>The gold smith was tried and found guilty of fraud.</p>
<p>And Archimedes continued to develop his research into density, along with his inventions and contributions to geometry.</p>
