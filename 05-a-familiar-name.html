<p>"Oh wonderful," the confectioner exclaimed. "You did that so quickly and accurately. If you ever need a job, let me know. But for now, you said you wanted me to answer questions for you?"</p>
<p>"I'm new to the city. Just got here," %%NAME%% explained, although %%SUBPRO%%--obviously--just got there from a different time in addition to a different place. "There seems to be a lot of uproar around here. Is it always like this?"</p>
<p>"No, no. Of course not! It's because of the festival. King Hiero has decided to hold a ceremony honoring the gods. And the most important part is the crown he will place in the temple. But rumors are astir that the goldsmith in charge of the crown stole some of the gold for himself and replaced it with a lesser metal. And if that's true the king will need to cancel everything. You can't give an impure crown to the gods, you know."</p>
<p>"Of course you can't. And who was it that passed through and made everyone quiet?" %%NAME%% inquired further.</p>
<p>"That was the king's cousin, Archimedes. He's a genius. Does hard math all the time and makes new inventions practically every week. You should see what he comes up with. I wouldn't be surprised if the king has asked him to help get to the bottom of the gold fiasco. If anyone could help, he could."</p>
<p><i>Hmmm. Archimedes could be a good person to find,</i> %%NAME%% thought. "Where can I find him? I'd love to meet him."</p>
<p>"You see that road there?" Sosibios pointed toward the closest corner of the agora, where Archimedes had disappeared some time before. </p>
<p>%%NAME%% nodded.</p>
<p>"Go out that exit and follow the road straight for four minutes or so. When you get to the bath houses, turn right. He lives on the next corner. Trust me; you can't miss it."</p>
<p>%%NAME%% thanked Sosibios for his help and hurried off in the direction the confectioner had indicated.</p>
