<p>%%NAME%% carried the proposal over to the bathhouse and handed it to Archimedes. Archimedes leapt from his bath and, without stopping to get dressed, ran out the building and down the street.</p>
<p>"Eureka!" %%NAME%% heard, over and over. "I found it!" </p>
<p>%%NAME%% ran after the voice, and very quickly found out where the naked man was headed. Straight to the palace! %%NAME%%, at least, had the forethought to stop by Archimedes's house and grab him a toga before sprinting to catch up.</p>
<p>%%NAME%%'s speed helped %%OBJPRO%% arrive at the palace at the same time as Archimedes. Archimedes grabbed the toga from %%OBJPRO%% without a word, as if it was understood all along that %%NAME%% would stop by the house to grab it.</p>
<p>Archimedes was let in to see his cousin, the king, immediately, and was still putting his clothes on when he walked into the room where King Hiero was sitting.</p>
<p>"Hello, Archimedes. And who is this?" The king gestured at %%NAME%%.</p>
<p>"This is %%NAME%%. %%SUBPRO_CAP%% assisted me in my experiments and helped me find a way to test your crown."</p>
<p>"Oh wonderful!" The king exclaimed with glee, a smile crossing his face for the first time since John laid eyes on him. He continued, "Now the people of Syracuse can stop their bickering. And what more, I have decided the festival will go on, crown or no."</p>
<p>The voices faded as the crown was dropped into a tub of water. And soon other the other noises of ancient Greece begin fading as well, replaced once again with the sounds of your living room. "It's fake!" were the last words you heard before Greece was left behind entirely.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>%%NAME%% returned to %%POS%% living room just as another notification popped up on %%POS%% device. </p>
