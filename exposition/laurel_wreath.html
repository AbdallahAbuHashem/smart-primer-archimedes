A laurel wreath is a circular wreath made of interlocking branches and leaves of the bay laurel (Laurus nobilis). This is an evergreen whose leaves give off a pleasant scent.

The wreath is traditionally worn on the head. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is shown wearing a laurel wreath because of the story of Apollo and Daphne. In Ancient Greece it was given to special people, such as winners in competitions in poetry or sports, such as the Ancient Olympic Games.
